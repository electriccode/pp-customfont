# pp-customfont

pp-customfont is a collection of custom icon fonts. I found fontawesome icons too clunky to use it either desktop or mobile app. So I decided to create one on my own. I used LinearIcons as starting point and adding more icons as per requirement.

The initial set of icons was derived from free version of linearicons (https://linearicons.com/) created by Perxis (https://perxis.com).
